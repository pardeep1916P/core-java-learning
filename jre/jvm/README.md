## JVM – Interview Q&A

### 1. What is JVM?
**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is a runtime engine that loads, verifies, and executes Java bytecode.  
It also manages memory allocation and garbage collection.

---

### 2. Is JVM platform dependent?
Yes, The JVM is platform dependent because it is specific to the operating system and hardware.

---

### 3. How does JVM enable platform independence?
Java source code is compiled into **platform-independent bytecode**, which can run on any system that has a compatible JVM.

---

### 4. What is bytecode?
Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler and executed by the JVM.

---

### 5. Can a Java program run without JVM?
No, A Java program requires a JVM to execute its bytecode.

---

### 6. Name the JVM runtime memory areas.
- Heap
- Stack
- Method Area
- Program Counter (PC) Register
- Native Method Stack

---

### 7. Where are objects stored in Java?
Objects are stored in the **Heap memory**.

---

### 8. What is the JIT compiler?
The **JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler** converts frequently executed bytecode into native machine code at runtime to improve performance.

---

### 9. Who manages memory in Java?
Memory allocation and deallocation are managed by the **JVM**, using the **Garbage Collector**.

---

### 10. Can garbage collection be forced?
No,Garbage collection cannot be forced. `System.gc()` is only a request to the JVM.
